Below is an end-to-end (E2E) test blueprint mapped directly to your v2 architecture. It’s organized in tiers so you can stage coverage: Tier-0 demo blockers, Tier-1 functional correctness, Tier-2 governance/compliance, Tier-3 resilience + scale. Each test flow has: Goal → Trigger/Input → Expected Artifacts Across Layers → Validation Methods → Automation Hooks. I’ve also included suggested folder layout, fixtures, environment matrix, and CI gating strategy.

Quick Orientation: What “Fully Working” Means Here

Your platform spans data → ontology → ML/agents → signals → UX → billing, under governed, audited access. “Fully working” =
	1.	Data arrives, normalizes, and is queryable.
	2.	Entities are fused & governed (masking, ACLs) consistently across storage & APIs.
	3.	Agents/ML produce actionable “signals” that flow to Marketplace + alerts.
	4.	User roles see only what they’re allowed; all actions are audited.
	5.	Feedback loops update models/pipelines.
	6.	Voice & UI paths function; billing gates usage.
	7.	System tolerates common faults (API hiccups, schema drift, replay/backfill).

Everything below is designed to exercise those invariants.

⸻

1. Test Taxonomy Overview

Tier	When Run	Purpose	Example Flows
T0 Smoke / Demo Blockers	Every PR + pre-demo	Minimal golden path works, UI loads, data visible	Ingest → Ontology lookup → Agent signal shows in dashboard.
T1 Functional / Regression	Nightly	Validate core behaviors under expected inputs	ER writes back; DLP masks; Slack feedback triggers retrain job.
T2 Governance / Compliance	Weekly or before enterprise demo	IAM, column masks, audit logs, lineage	Restricted user cannot see PII columns; access logged.
T3 Resilience / Scale / Chaos	On demand or pre-launch	Fault injection, replay, throughput	Drop Pub/Sub subscription; backfill recovers no duplication.

2. E2E Test Matrix by Architecture Layer

I’ll label tests E2E-<LAYER>-<NN> for folder grouping.

⸻

0. Identity & Access

E2E-IA-01: Role-Based BigQuery Column Visibility
	•	Goal: Confirm DLP + column-level ACLs enforce masking for restricted roles.
	•	Trigger: Query curated table w/ sensitive cols as (a) Admin, (b) Analyst, (c) External/Token user.
	•	Expect: Admin sees raw; Analyst sees masked (**** or NULL); External sees column omitted or error.
	•	Validate: Compare query result schemas + values; audit log entry emitted.

E2E-IA-02: End-to-End Mask Propagation to API
	•	Query same dataset through API Gateway REST/gRPC using different API keys mapped to IAM roles.
	•	Confirm response JSON matches masking rules identical to direct BigQuery query.

E2E-IA-03: Access Denied Event Audited
	•	Attempt unauthorized ontology mutation; ensure Cloud Audit Logs + custom audit_sink.py capture principal, resource, timestamp.

⸻

1. Ingestion Layer

E2E-ING-01: Live Chain Event Pull & Normalize
	•	Trigger: Inject deterministic synthetic on-chain tx via local fork or fixture JSON push into WS feed mock.
	•	Pipeline: Cloud Function → Pub/Sub → Dataflow → Raw BigQuery.
	•	Expect: Raw table row created; normalized chain-event JSON in curated table.
	•	Validate: Row counts; schema mapping; checksum on fixture ID.

E2E-ING-02: Multi-Source Merge Consistency
	•	Feed same address/activity via Alchemy and TheGraph mocks; dedupe logic should not double count.
	•	Validate record uniqueness + source attribution metadata.

E2E-ING-03: Backfill Replay Idempotency
	•	Re-run seed_bigquery.sh (or Dataflow replay) over day N; curated table should not duplicate prior batch (test idempotent keys).

E2E-ING-04: Schema Drift Alert
	•	Introduce extra field in incoming JSON; ensure Dataflow routes to error DLQ topic and surfaces Grafana alert.

⸻

2. Semantic Fusion Layer

E2E-SEM-01: Ontology Load & Roundtrip
	•	Load seed ontology (contracts, addresses, institution tags) with loader.py.
	•	Query via graph_api.py GraphQL; verify node/edge counts and key attrs match seed file.

E2E-SEM-02: Entity Resolution Writeback
	•	Provide fixture: multiple chain addresses known to belong to same exchange.
	•	Run entity_resolution/pipeline.py (Vertex AI job).
	•	Expect: new entity_id attached in BigQuery curated table rows + Neo4j relationship edges.
	•	Validate referential integrity: all source addresses map to single entity; no orphan edges.

E2E-SEM-03: Governance Tag Propagation
	•	Tag ontology entity as “Restricted_Jurisdiction”.
	•	Confirm downstream queries auto-inherit policy in policies.yaml (access_control service) → restricted users blocked from seeing linked signals.

⸻

3. Intelligence & Agent Mesh

E2E-AG-01: Agent Subscription & Signal Publish
	•	Publish synthetic high-value transfer to Pub/Sub.
	•	MEV or Whale Tracker agent in GKE consumes message, queries Ontology for entity enrichment, emits Signal doc to Marketplace topic.
	•	Validate: Marketplace table updated; dashboard signal card appears.

E2E-AG-02: Risk Model Scoring Path
	•	Ingest suspicious cluster; Risk AI (GBDT) scores > threshold; triggers sanctions_alert agent.
	•	Expect Slack alert + API signal + stored score in BigQuery risk table.

E2E-AG-03: Graph-SAGE Feature Drift Guard
	•	Run training, then feed out-of-distribution graph slice; pipeline should log drift metric > tolerance and mark model for retrain queue.

E2E-AG-04: Horizontal Scaling (HPA)
	•	Burst 10k chain events; watch K8s HPA scale agent deployments; ensure no backlog > SLA (e.g., <2m).

⸻

4. API & VoiceOps Layer

E2E-API-01: REST Query → Fused Data Response
	•	Request: /entities/{entity_id}/activity?since=...
	•	Server hits BigQuery + Ontology; returns fused timeline.
	•	Validate schema, counts, sort order, ACL compliance.

E2E-API-02: Streaming WebSocket Updates
	•	Subscribe to address; push new chain event; confirm client receives push within latency budget.

E2E-VOICE-01: STT→Intent→Action Flow
	•	Provide audio “Monitor address 0xABC for > $1M transfers.”
	•	ElevenLabs STT returns text; intent router creates Dagster job.
	•	After job created, ingestion monitors; when condition met, voice TTS alert back.
	•	Validate full roundtrip (audio in → job created → event → audio out).

⸻

5. UX & Workflow Builder

E2E-UX-01: War-Room Dashboard Role Views
	•	Log in as Admin vs Analyst vs External.
	•	Confirm nav tabs, row counts, redacted values differ per role; charts reflect filtered data.

E2E-UX-02: Build Signal in Dagster UI
	•	User creates threshold signal pipeline referencing ontology tags.
	•	Deploy; underlying Dagster worker emits pipeline spec → Pub/Sub; agent subscribes & enforces.
	•	Validate newly created signal fires on synthetic event.

E2E-UX-03: Inline Data Traceability
	•	From dashboard entity card, click “lineage”.
	•	Should show raw events → curated table → entity resolution join → signal.
	•	Validate links resolve, metadata present.

⸻

6. Launch & Growth (Token Gate + Billing)

E2E-LAUNCH-01: Pond Markets Token Gate
	•	Wallet w/ required token balance can request API key; wallet without gets 402-style error.
	•	Validate via on-chain read + backend entitlement mapping.

E2E-LAUNCH-02: Stripe Metering & Billing
	•	Simulate N API calls across pricing tiers.
	•	Stripe usage records accumulate; invoice preview shows correct prorated charges.
	•	If overage threshold crossed, API throttles or warns.

⸻

3. Cross-Cutting Governance, Audit, and Feedback Loops

DLP & Data Governance

E2E-GOV-01: Sensitive Field Leak Check
	•	Run diff between raw and curated masked exports; ensure masked columns never appear in non-privileged exports, logs, or UI network payloads.

E2E-GOV-02: Policy Change Propagation Latency
	•	Update policies.yaml (access_control) to newly restrict a field.
	•	Measure time until API + UI reflect change; target <5m or defined SLA.

Audit & Lineage

E2E-AUD-01: Full Audit Trace
	•	Perform a governed query from UI; produce an audit bundle: user identity, time, query text, data assets touched, row counts.
	•	Validate Cloud Logging + custom audit sink store all fields and are immutable (append-only).

Feedback → Retrain

E2E-FB-01: Slack “Mark False Positive” Button
	•	Analyst marks alert false.
	•	Pub/Sub message triggers Vertex pipeline retrain job with updated label.
	•	New model deployed; subsequent similar event suppressed or lower score.
	•	Validate label ingestion, model version increment, inference behavior change.

⸻

4. Minimal “Demo Must-Pass” Subset (Tier-0)

If time-crunched, greenlight demo when these pass:
	1.	T0-A: Ingest synthetic tx → appears in BigQuery.
	2.	T0-B: Ontology enrichment adds entity name → visible in API response.
	3.	T0-C: Agent emits signal to dashboard on threshold breach.
	4.	T0-D: Analyst marks signal false in Slack → feedback recorded.
	5.	T0-E: Restricted user sees masked data.

⸻

5. Test Data Strategy

Synthetic Fixture Packs

Store under tests/e2e/fixtures/:

Fixture	Used For	Notes
tx_simple.json	Smoke ingestion	Single ERC-20 transfer.
tx_multi_source.json	Source dedupe	Same event via Alchemy + TheGraph.
entity_cluster.json	ER pipeline	Multiple addresses → one exchange.
suspicious_flow.jsonl	Risk scoring, sanctions alert	Labeled ground truth.
pii_dataset.csv	DLP masking tests	Contains fields flagged sensitive.

Golden Output Snapshots

Under tests/e2e/golden/ store expected BigQuery query results (Parquet/CSV), API JSON responses, Ontology Graph dumps (Cypher export). Use snapshot testing w/ allowlist for timestamp drift.

⸻

6. Automation & Tooling Recommendations

Harness Stack
	•	pytest + pytest-asyncio for Python-heavy integration.
	•	gcloud sdk + bq cli wrappers inside fixtures utils.
	•	Playwright (preferred over Cypress for TS monorepos) for Next.js War-Room UI + role switching.
	•	k6 or Locust for streaming / throughput tests.
	•	Terraform test harness: after terraform apply in ephemeral project, run smoke tests automatically.

Running Tests Against Ephemeral GCP Projects

Script scripts/local_dev_env.sh can spin a short-lived project; inject service account creds; tear down after run to control cost.

8. Sample Well-Commented Test (Python)

# tests/e2e/semantic_fusion/test_er_writeback.py
"""
E2E-SEM-02: Entity Resolution Writeback
Validates that when the ER pipeline runs it:
  1. Reads unlabeled addresses from curated BigQuery chain_events table.
  2. Produces entity_id assignments (Vertex AI batch prediction / custom job).
  3. Writes entity_id back into BigQuery + creates relationships in Neo4j.
  4. Surfaces enriched entity in GraphQL Ontology API.

We run against an ephemeral GCP project seeded with fixtures/entity_cluster.json.
