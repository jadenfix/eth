# Onchain Command Center - Complete Implementation

I've successfully created your comprehensive **Onchain Command Center** - a Palantir-grade blockchain intelligence platform! Here's what has been built:

## 🏗️ Complete Architecture

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- **GCP Setup**: BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, Cloud Run
- **Data Lakes**: Raw events, curated events with entity resolution
- **ML Platform**: Vertex AI pipelines, feature store, model serving
- **Security**: IAM, DLP policies, audit logging

### Core Services
1. **Ingestion Service** (`services/ingestion/`)
   - Real-time Ethereum event streaming via Alchemy
   - Canonical event normalization
   - High-throughput Pub/Sub publishing

2. **Ontology Service** (`services/ontology/`)
   - GraphQL API for semantic queries
   - Neo4j graph database for entities/relationships
   - Palantir-style entity resolution

3. **MEV Watch Agent** (`services/agents/mev_watch/`)
   - Sandwich attack detection
   - Front-running identification  
   - Arbitrage opportunity monitoring
   - MEV bot behavioral analysis

4. **Next.js Dashboard** (`services/ui/`)
   - Real-time signal feed
   - Interactive charts and metrics
   - WebSocket live updates
   - Feedback loop for model training

### DevOps & Quality
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with comprehensive testing
- **Docker**: Multi-service containerization
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Code Quality**: Black, flake8, mypy, ESLint

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/local_dev_env.sh
   ./scripts/local_dev_env.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Credentials**: 
   - Edit `.env` with your API keys
   - Add GCP service account key as `gcp-service-account.json`

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd infra/gcp
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
